Dorothy
lived
in
the
midst
of
the
great
Kansas
prairies
with
Uncle
Henry
who
was
a
farmer
and
Aunt
Em
who
was
the
farmer's
wife
Their
house
was
small
for
the
lumber
to
build
it
had
to
be
carried
by
wagon
many
miles
There
were
four
walls
a
floor
and
a
roof
which
made
one
room
and
this
room
contained
a
rusty
looking
cookstove
a
cupboard
for
the
dishes
a
table
three
or
four
chairs
and
the
beds
Uncle
Henry
and
Aunt
Em
had
a
big
bed
in
one
corner
and
Dorothy
a
little
bed
in
another
corner
There
was
no
garret
at
all
and
no
cellar
except
a
small
hole
dug
in
the
ground
called
a
cyclone
cellar
where
the
family
could
go
in
case
one
of
those
great
whirlwinds
arose
mighty
enough
to
crush
any
building
in
its
path
It
was
reached
by
a
trap
door
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
from
which
a
ladder
led
down
into
the
small
dark
hole
When
Dorothy
stood
in
the
doorway
and
looked
around
she
could
see
nothing
but
the
great
gray
prairie
on
every
side
Not
a
tree
nor
a
house
broke
the
broad
sweep
of
flat
country
that
reached
to
the
edge
of
the
sky
in
all
directions
The
sun
had
baked
the
plowed
land
into
a
gray
mass
with
little
cracks
running
through
it
Even
the
grass
was
not
green
for
the
sun
had
burned
the
tops
of
the
long
blades
until
they
were
the
same
gray
color
to
be
seen
everywhere
Once
the
house
had
been
painted
but
the
sun
blistered
the
paint
and
the
rains
washed
it
away
and
now
the
house
was
as
dull
and
gray
as
everything
else
When
Aunt
Em
came
there
to
live
she
was
a
young
pretty
wife
The
sun
and
wind
had
changed
her
too
They
had
taken
the
sparkle
from
her
eyes
and
left
them
a
sober
gray
they
had
taken
the
red
from
her
cheeks
and
lips
and
they
were
gray
also
She
was
thin
and
gaunt
and
never
smiled
now
When
Dorothy
who
was
an
orphan
first
came
to
her
Aunt
Em
had
been
so
startled
by
the
child's
laughter
that
she
would
scream
and
press
her
hand
upon
her
heart
whenever
Dorothy's
merry
voice
reached
her
ears
and
she
still
looked
at
the
little
girl
with
wonder
that
she
could
find
anything
to
laugh
at
Uncle
Henry
never
laughed
He
worked
hard
from
morning
till
night
and
did
not
know
what
joy
was
He
was
gray
also
from
his
long
beard
to
his
rough
boots
and
he
looked
stern
and
solemn
and
rarely
spoke
It
was
Toto
that
made
Dorothy
laugh
and
saved
her
from
growing
as
gray
as
her
other
surroundings
Toto
was
not
gray
he
was
a
little
black
dog
with
long
silky
hair
and
small
black
eyes
that
twinkled
merrily
on
either
side
of
his
funny
wee
nose
Toto
played
all
day
long
and
Dorothy
played
with
him
and
loved
him
dearly
Today
however
they
were
not
playing
Uncle
Henry
sat
upon
the
doorstep
and
looked
anxiously
at
the
sky
which
was
even
grayer
than
usual
Dorothy
stood
in
the
door
with
Toto
in
her
arms
and
looked
at
the
sky
too
Aunt
Em
was
washing
the
dishes
From
the
far
north
they
heard
a
low
wail
of
the
wind
and
Uncle
Henry
and
Dorothy
could
see
where
the
long
grass
bowed
in
waves
before
the
coming
storm
There
now
came
a
sharp
whistling
in
the
air
from
the
south
and
as
they
turned
their
eyes
that
way
they
saw
ripples
in
the
grass
coming
from
that
direction
also
Suddenly
Uncle
Henry
stood
up
There's
a
cyclone
coming
Em
he
called
to
his
wife
I'll
go
look
after
the
stock
Then
he
ran
toward
the
sheds
where
the
cows
and
horses
were
kept
Aunt
Em
dropped
her
work
and
came
to
the
door
One
glance
told
her
of
the
danger
close
at
hand
Quick
Dorothy
she
screamed
Run
for
the
cellar
Toto
jumped
out
of
Dorothy's
arms
and
hid
under
the
bed
and
the
girl
started
to
get
him
Aunt
Em
badly
frightened
threw
open
the
trap
door
in
the
floor
and
climbed
down
the
ladder
into
the
small
dark
hole
Dorothy
caught
Toto
at
last
and
started
to
follow
her
aunt
When
she
was
halfway
across
the
room
there
came
a
great
shriek
from
the
wind
and
the
house
shook
so
hard
that
she
lost
her
footing
and
sat
down
suddenly
upon
the
floor
Then
a
strange
thing
happened
The
house
whirled
around
two
or
three
times
and
rose
slowly
through
the
air
Dorothy
felt
as
if
she
were
going
up
in
a
balloon
The
north
and
south
winds
met
where
the
house
stood
and
made
it
the
exact
center
of
the
cyclone
In
the
middle
of
a
cyclone
the
air
is
generally
still
but
the
great
pressure
of
the
wind
on
every
side
of
the
house
raised
it
up
higher
and
higher
until
it
was
at
the
very
top
of
the
cyclone
and
there
it
remained
and
was
carried
miles
and
miles
away
as
easily
as
you
could
carry
a
feather
It
was
very
dark
and
the
wind
howled
horribly
around
her
but
Dorothy
found
she
was
riding
quite
easily
After
the
first
few
whirls
around
and
one
other
time
when
the
house
tipped
badly
she
felt
as
if
she
were
being
rocked
gently
like
a
baby
in
a
cradle
Toto
did
not
like
it
He
ran
about
the
room
now
here
now
there
barking
loudly
but
Dorothy
sat
quite
still
on
the
floor
and
waited
to
see
what
would
happen
Once
Toto
got
too
near
the
open
trap
door
and
fell
in
and
at
first
the
little
girl
thought
she
had
lost
him
But
soon
she
saw
one
of
his
ears
sticking
up
through
the
hole
for
the
strong
pressure
of
the
air
was
keeping
him
up
so
that
he
could
not
fall
She
crept
to
the
hole
caught
Toto
by
the
ear
and
dragged
him
into
the
room
again
afterward
closing
the
trap
door
so
that
no
more
accidents
could
happen
Hour
after
hour
passed
away
and
slowly
Dorothy
got
over
her
fright
but
she
felt
quite
lonely
and
the
wind
shrieked
so
loudly
all
about
her
that
she
nearly
became
deaf
At
first
she
had
wondered
if
she
would
be
dashed
to
pieces
when
the
house
fell
again
but
as
the
hours
passed
and
nothing
terrible
happened
she
stopped
worrying
and
resolved
to
wait
calmly
and
see
what
the
future
would
bring
At
last
she
crawled
over
the
swaying
floor
to
her
bed
and
lay
down
upon
it
and
Toto
followed
and
lay
down
beside
her
In
spite
of
the
swaying
of
the
house
and
the
wailing
of
the
wind
Dorothy
soon
closed
her
eyes
and
fell
fast
asleep
The
brown
fox
quickly
jumped
over
the
lazy
red
dogs
again
and
again
The
red
foxes
quickly
jumps
over
those
lazy
browner
dog
However
most
of
the
quicker
foxes
jumping
over
the
dog
are
lazy

I
DOWN
THE
RABBIT
HOLE
Alice
was
beginning
to
get
very
tired
of
sitting
by
her
sister
on
the
bank
and
of
having
nothing
to
do
Once
or
twice
she
had
peeped
into
the
book
her
sister
was
reading
but
it
had
no
pictures
or
conversations
in
it
and
what
is
the
use
of
a
book
thought
Alice
without
pictures
or
conversations
So
she
was
considering
in
her
own
mind
as
well
as
she
could
for
the
day
made
her
feel
very
sleepy
and
stupid
whether
the
pleasure
of
making
a
daisy
chain
would
be
worth
the
trouble
of
getting
up
and
picking
the
daisies
when
suddenly
a
White
Rabbit
with
pink
eyes
ran
close
by
her
There
was
nothing
so
very
remarkable
in
that
nor
did
Alice
think
it
so
very
much
out
of
the
way
to
hear
the
Rabbit
say
to
itself
Oh
dear
Oh
dear
I
shall
be
too
late
But
when
the
Rabbit
actually
took
a
watch
out
of
its
waistcoat
pocket
and
looked
at
it
and
then
hurried
on
Alice
started
to
her
feet
for
it
flashed
across
her
mind
that
she
had
never
before
seen
a
rabbit
with
either
a
waistcoat
pocket
or
a
watch
to
take
out
of
it
and
burning
with
curiosity
she
ran
across
the
field
after
it
and
was
just
in
time
to
see
it
pop
down
a
large
rabbit
hole
under
the
hedge
In
another
moment
down
went
Alice
after
it
Illustration
The
rabbit
hole
went
straight
on
like
a
tunnel
for
some
way
and
then
dipped
suddenly
down
so
suddenly
that
Alice
had
not
a
moment
to
think
about
stopping
herself
before
she
found
herself
falling
down
what
seemed
to
be
a
very
deep
well
Either
the
well
was
very
deep
or
she
fell
very
slowly
for
she
had
plenty
of
time
as
she
went
down
to
look
about
her
First
she
tried
to
make
out
what
she
was
coming
to
but
it
was
too
dark
to
see
anything
then
she
looked
at
the
sides
of
the
well
and
noticed
that
they
were
filled
with
cupboards
and
book
shelves
here
and
there
she
saw
maps
and
pictures
hung
upon
pegs
She
took
down
a
jar
from
one
of
the
shelves
as
she
passed
It
was
labeled
ORANGE
MARMALADE
but
to
her
great
disappointment
it
was
empty
she
did
not
like
to
drop
the
jar
so
managed
to
put
it
into
one
of
the
cupboards
as
she
fell
past
it
Down
down
down
Would
the
fall
never
come
to
an
end
There
was
nothing
else
to
do
so
Alice
soon
began
talking
to
herself
Dinah'll
miss
me
very
much
to
night
I
should
think
Dinah
was
the
cat
I
hope
they'll
remember
her
saucer
of
milk
at
tea
time
Dinah
my
dear
I
wish
you
were
down
here
with
me
Alice
felt
that
she
was
dozing
off
when
suddenly
thump
thump
down
she
came
upon
a
heap
of
sticks
and
dry
leaves
and
the
fall
was
over
Alice
was
not
a
bit
hurt
and
she
jumped
up
in
a
moment
She
looked
up
but
it
was
all
dark
overhead
before
her
was
another
long
passage
and
the
White
Rabbit
was
still
in
sight
hurrying
down
it
There
was
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
Away
went
Alice
like
the
wind
and
was
just
in
time
to
hear
it
say
as
it
turned
a
corner
Oh
my
ears
and
whiskers
how
late
it's
getting
She
was
close
behind
it
when
she
turned
the
corner
but
the
Rabbit
was
no
longer
to
be
seen
She
found
herself
in
a
long
low
hall
which
was
lit
up
by
a
row
of
lamps
hanging
from
the
roof
There
were
doors
all
round
the
hall
but
they
were
all
locked
and
when
Alice
had
been
all
the
way
down
one
side
and
up
the
other
trying
every
door
she
walked
sadly
down
the
middle
wondering
how
she
was
ever
to
get
out
again
Suddenly
she
came
upon
a
little
table
all
made
of
solid
glass
There
was
nothing
on
it
but
a
tiny
golden
key
and
Alice's
first
idea
was
that
this
might
belong
to
one
of
the
doors
of
the
hall
but
alas
either
the
locks
were
too
large
or
the
key
was
too
small
but
at
any
rate
it
would
not
open
any
of
them
However
on
the
second
time
round
she
came
upon
a
low
curtain
she
had
not
noticed
before
and
behind
it
was
a
little
door
about
fifteen
inches
high
She
tried
the
little
golden
key
in
the
lock
and
to
her
great
delight
it
fitted
Illustration
Alice
opened
the
door
and
found
that
it
led
into
a
small
passage
not
much
larger
than
a
rat
hole
she
knelt
down
and
looked
along
the
passage
into
the
loveliest
garden
you
ever
saw
How
she
longed
to
get
out
of
that
dark
hall
and
wander
about
among
those
beds
of
bright
flowers
and
those
cool
fountains
but
she
could
not
even
get
her
head
through
the
doorway
Oh
said
Alice
how
I
wish
I
could
shut
up
like
a
telescope
I
think
I
could
if
I
only
knew
how
to
begin
Alice
went
back
to
the
table
half
hoping
she
might
find
another
key
on
it
or
at
any
rate
a
book
of
rules
for
shutting
people
up
like
telescopes
This
time
she
found
a
little
bottle
on
it
which
certainly
was
not
here
before
said
Alice
and
tied
round
the
neck
of
the
bottle
was
a
paper
label
with
the
words
DRINK
ME
beautifully
printed
on
it
in
large
letters
No
I'll
look
first
she
said
and
see
whether
it's
marked
poison
or
not
for
she
had
never
forgotten
that
if
you
drink
from
a
bottle
marked
poison
it
is
almost
certain
to
disagree
with
you
sooner
or
later
However
this
bottle
was
not
marked
poison
so
Alice
ventured
to
taste
it
and
finding
it
very
nice
it
had
a
sort
of
mixed
flavor
of
cherry
tart
custard
pineapple
roast
turkey
toffy
and
hot
buttered
toast
she
very
soon
finished
it
off
What
a
curious
feeling
said
Alice
I
must
be
shutting
up
like
a
telescope
And
so
it
was
indeed
She
was
now
only
ten
inches
high
and
her
face
brightened
up
at
the
thought
that
she
was
now
the
right
size
for
going
through
the
little
door
into
that
lovely
garden
After
awhile
finding
that
nothing
more
happened
she
decided
on
going
into
the
garden
at
once
but
alas
for
poor
Alice
When
she
got
to
the
door
she
found
she
had
forgotten
the
little
golden
key
and
when
she
went
back
to
the
table
for
it
she
found
she
could
not
possibly
reach
it
she
could
see
it
quite
plainly
through
the
glass
and
she
tried
her
best
to
climb
up
one
of
the
legs
of
the
table
but
it
was
too
slippery
and
when
she
had
tired
herself
out
with
trying
the
poor
little
thing
sat
down
and
cried
Come
there's
no
use
in
crying
like
that
said
Alice
to
herself
rather
sharply
I
advise
you
to
leave
off
this
minute
She
generally
gave
herself
very
good
advice
though
she
very
seldom
followed
it
and
sometimes
she
scolded
herself
so
severely
as
to
bring
tears
into
her
eyes
Soon
her
eye
fell
on
a
little
glass
box
that
was
lying
under
the
table
she
opened
it
and
found
in
it
a
very
small
cake
on
which
the
words
EAT
ME
were
beautifully
marked
in
currants
Well
I'll
eat
it
said
Alice
and
if
it
makes
me
grow
larger
I
can
reach
the
key
and
if
it
makes
me
grow
smaller
I
can
creep
under
the
door
so
either
way
I'll
get
into
the
garden
and
I
don't
care
which
happens
She
ate
a
little
bit
and
said
anxiously
to
herself
Which
way
Which
way
holding
her
hand
on
the
top
of
her
head
to
feel
which
way
she
was
growing
and
she
was
quite
surprised
to
find
that
she
remained
the
same
size
So
she
set
to
work
and
very
soon
finished
off
the
cake

II
THE
POOL
OF
TEARS
Curiouser
and
curiouser
cried
Alice
she
was
so
much
surprised
that
for
the
moment
she
quite
forgot
how
to
speak
good
English
Now
I'm
opening
out
like
the
largest
telescope
that
ever
was
Good
by
feet
Oh
my
poor
little
feet
I
wonder
who
will
put
on
your
shoes
and
stockings
for
you
now
dears
I
shall
be
a
great
deal
too
far
off
to
trouble
myself
about
you
Just
at
this
moment
her
head
struck
against
the
roof
of
the
hall
in
fact
she
was
now
rather
more
than
nine
feet
high
and
she
at
once
took
up
the
little
golden
key
and
hurried
off
to
the
garden
door
Poor
Alice
It
was
as
much
as
she
could
do
lying
down
on
one
side
to
look
through
into
the
garden
with
one
eye
but
to
get
through
was
more
hopeless
than
ever
She
sat
down
and
began
to
cry
again
She
went
on
shedding
gallons
of
tears
until
there
was
a
large
pool
all
round
her
and
reaching
half
down
the
hall
After
a
time
she
heard
a
little
pattering
of
feet
in
the
distance
and
she
hastily
dried
her
eyes
to
see
what
was
coming
It
was
the
White
Rabbit
returning
splendidly
dressed
with
a
pair
of
white
kid
gloves
in
one
hand
and
a
large
fan
in
the
other
He
came
trotting
along
in
a
great
hurry
muttering
to
himself
Oh
the
Duchess
the
Duchess
Oh
won't
she
be
savage
if
I've
kept
her
waiting
When
the
Rabbit
came
near
her
Alice
began
in
a
low
timid
voice
If
you
please
sir
The
Rabbit
started
violently
dropped
the
white
kid
gloves
and
the
fan
and
skurried
away
into
the
darkness
as
hard
as
he
could
go
Illustration
Alice
took
up
the
fan
and
gloves
and
she
kept
fanning
herself
all
the
time
she
went
on
talking
Dear
dear
How
queer
everything
is
to
day
And
yesterday
things
went
on
just
as
usual
Was
I
the
same
when
I
got
up
this
morning
But
if
I'm
not
the
same
the
next
question
is
Who
in
the
world
am
I
Ah
that's
the
great
puzzle
As
she
said
this
she
looked
down
at
her
hands
and
was
surprised
to
see
that
she
had
put
on
one
of
the
Rabbit's
little
white
kid
gloves
while
she
was
talking
How
can
I
have
done
that
she
thought
I
must
be
growing
small
again
She
got
up
and
went
to
the
table
to
measure
herself
by
it
and
found
that
she
was
now
about
two
feet
high
and
was
going
on
shrinking
rapidly
She
soon
found
out
that
the
cause
of
this
was
the
fan
she
was
holding
and
she
dropped
it
hastily
just
in
time
to
save
herself
from
shrinking
away
altogether
That
was
a
narrow
escape
said
Alice
a
good
deal
frightened
at
the
sudden
change
but
very
glad
to
find
herself
still
in
existence
And
now
for
the
garden
And
she
ran
with
all
speed
back
to
the
little
door
but
alas
the
little
door
was
shut
again
and
the
little
golden
key
was
lying
on
the
glass
table
as
before
Things
are
worse
than
ever
thought
the
poor
child
for
I
never
was
so
small
as
this
before
never
As
she
said
these
words
her
foot
slipped
and
in
another
moment
splash
she
was
up
to
her
chin
in
salt
water
Her
first
idea
was
that
she
had
somehow
fallen
into
the
sea
However
she
soon
made
out
that
she
was
in
the
pool
of
tears
which
she
had
wept
when
she
was
nine
feet
high
Illustration
Just
then
she
heard
something
splashing
about
in
the
pool
a
little
way
off
and
she
swam
nearer
to
see
what
it
was
she
soon
made
out
that
it
was
only
a
mouse
that
had
slipped
in
like
herself
Would
it
be
of
any
use
now
thought
Alice
to
speak
to
this
mouse
Everything
is
so
out
of
the
way
down
here
that
I
should
think
very
likely
it
can
talk
at
any
rate
there's
no
harm
in
trying
So
she
began
O
Mouse
do
you
know
the
way
out
of
this
pool
I
am
very
tired
of
swimming
about
here
O
Mouse
The
Mouse
looked
at
her
rather
inquisitively
and
seemed
to
her
to
wink
with
one
of
its
little
eyes
but
it
said
nothing
Perhaps
it
doesn't
understand
English
thought
Alice
I
dare
say
it's
a
French
mouse
come
over
with
William
the
Conqueror
So
she
began
again
Ou
est
ma
chatte
which
was
the
first
sentence
in
her
French
lesson
book
The
Mouse
gave
a
sudden
leap
out
of
the
water
and
seemed
to
quiver
all
over
with
fright
Oh
I
beg
your
pardon
cried
Alice
hastily
afraid
that
she
had
hurt
the
poor
animal's
feelings
I
quite
forgot
you
didn't
like
cats
Not
like
cats
cried
the
Mouse
in
a
shrill
passionate
voice
Would
you
like
cats
if
you
were
me
Well
perhaps
not
said
Alice
in
a
soothing
tone
don't
be
angry
about
it
And
yet
I
wish
I
could
show
you
our
cat
Dinah
I
think
you'd
take
a
fancy
to
cats
if
you
could
only
see
her
She
is
such
a
dear
quiet
thing
The
Mouse
was
bristling
all
over
and
she
felt
certain
it
must
be
really
offended
We
won't
talk
about
her
any
more
if
you'd
rather
not
We
indeed
cried
the
Mouse
who
was
trembling
down
to
the
end
of
its
tail
As
if
I
would
talk
on
such
a
subject
Our
family
always
hated
cats
nasty
low
vulgar
things
Don't
let
me
hear
the
name
again
Illustration
Alice
at
the
Mad
Tea
Party
I
won't
indeed
said
Alice
in
a
great
hurry
to
change
the
subject
of
conversation
Are
you
are
you
fond
of
of
dogs
There
is
such
a
nice
little
dog
near
our
house
I
should
like
to
show
you
It
kills
all
the
rats
and
oh
dear
cried
Alice
in
a
sorrowful
tone
I'm
afraid
I've
offended
it
again
For
the
Mouse
was
swimming
away
from
her
as
hard
as
it
could
go
and
making
quite
a
commotion
in
the
pool
as
it
went
So
she
called
softly
after
it
Mouse
dear
Do
come
back
again
and
we
won't
talk
about
cats
or
dogs
either
if
you
don't
like
them
When
the
Mouse
heard
this
it
turned
round
and
swam
slowly
back
to
her
its
face
was
quite
pale
and
it
said
in
a
low
trembling
voice
Let
us
get
to
the
shore
and
then
I'll
tell
you
my
history
and
you'll
understand
why
it
is
I
hate
cats
and
dogs
It
was
high
time
to
go
for
the
pool
was
getting
quite
crowded
with
the
birds
and
animals
that
had
fallen
into
it
there
were
a
Duck
and
a
Dodo
a
Lory
and
an
Eaglet
and
several
other
curious
creatures
Alice
led
the
way
and
the
whole
party
swam
to
the
shore

III
A
CAUCUS
RACE
AND
A
LONG
TALE
They
were
indeed
a
queer
looking
party
that
assembled
on
the
bank
the
birds
with
draggled
feathers
the
animals
with
their
fur
clinging
close
to
them
and
all
dripping
wet
cross
and
uncomfortable
Illustration
The
first
question
of
course
was
how
to
get
dry
again
They
had
a
consultation
about
this
and
after
a
few
minutes
it
seemed
quite
natural
to
Alice
to
find
herself
talking
familiarly
with
them
as
if
she
had
known
them
all
her
life
At
last
the
Mouse
who
seemed
to
be
a
person
of
some
authority
among
them
called
out
Sit
down
all
of
you
and
listen
to
me
I'll
soon
make
you
dry
enough
They
all
sat
down
at
once
in
a
large
ring
with
the
Mouse
in
the
middle
Ahem
said
the
Mouse
with
an
important
air
Are
you
all
ready
This
is
the
driest
thing
I
know
Silence
all
round
if
you
please
William
the
Conqueror
whose
cause
was
favored
by
the
pope
was
soon
submitted
to
by
the
English
who
wanted
leaders
and
had
been
of
late
much
accustomed
to
usurpation
and
conquest
Edwin
and
Morcar
the
Earls
of
Mercia
and
Northumbria
Ugh
said
the
Lory
with
a
shiver
And
even
Stigand
the
patriotic
archbishop
of
Canterbury
found
it
advisable
Found
what
said
the
Duck
Found
it
the
Mouse
replied
rather
crossly
of
course
you
know
what
it
means
I
know
what
it
means
well
enough
when
I
find
a
thing
said
the
Duck
it's
generally
a
frog
or
a
worm
The
question
is
what
did
the
archbishop
find
The
Mouse
did
not
notice
this
question
but
hurriedly
went
on
found
it
advisable
to
go
with
Edgar
Atheling
to
meet
William
and
offer
him
the
crown
How
are
you
getting
on
now
my
dear
it
continued
turning
to
Alice
as
it
spoke
As
wet
as
ever
said
Alice
in
a
melancholy
tone
it
doesn't
seem
to
dry
me
at
all
In
that
case
said
the
Dodo
solemnly
rising
to
its
feet
I
move
that
the
meeting
adjourn
for
the
immediate
adoption
of
more
energetic
remedies
Speak
English
said
the
Eaglet
I
don't
know
the
meaning
of
half
those
long
words
and
what's
more
I
don't
believe
you
do
either
What
I
was
going
to
say
said
the
Dodo
in
an
offended
tone
is
that
the
best
thing
to
get
us
dry
would
be
a
Caucus
race
What
is
a
Caucus
race
said
Alice
Illustration
Why
said
the
Dodo
the
best
way
to
explain
it
is
to
do
it
First
it
marked
out
a
race
course
in
a
sort
of
circle
and
then
all
the
party
were
placed
along
the
course
here
and
there
There
was
no
One
two
three
and
away
but
they
began
running
when
they
liked
and
left
off
when
they
liked
so
that
it
was
not
easy
to
know
when
the
race
was
over
However
when
they
had
been
running
half
an
hour
or
so
and
were
quite
dry
again
the
Dodo
suddenly
called
out
The
race
is
over
and
they
all
crowded
round
it
panting
and
asking
But
who
has
won
This
question
the
Dodo
could
not
answer
without
a
great
deal
of
thought
At
last
it
said
Everybody
has
won
and
all
must
have
prizes
But
who
is
to
give
the
prizes
quite
a
chorus
of
voices
asked
Why
she
of
course
said
the
Dodo
pointing
to
Alice
with
one
finger
and
the
whole
party
at
once
crowded
round
her
calling
out
in
a
confused
way
Prizes
Prizes
Alice
had
no
idea
what
to
do
and
in
despair
she
put
her
hand
into
her
pocket
and
pulled
out
a
box
of
comfits
luckily
the
salt
water
had
not
got
into
it
and
handed
them
round
as
prizes
There
was
exactly
one
a
piece
all
round
The
next
thing
was
to
eat
the
comfits
this
caused
some
noise
and
confusion
as
the
large
birds
complained
that
they
could
not
taste
theirs
and
the
small
ones
choked
and
had
to
be
patted
on
the
back
However
it
was
over
at
last
and
they
sat
down
again
in
a
ring
and
begged
the
Mouse
to
tell
them
something
more
You
promised
to
tell
me
your
history
you
know
said
Alice
and
why
it
is
you
hate
C
and
D
she
added
in
a
whisper
half
afraid
that
it
would
be
offended
again
Mine
is
a
long
and
a
sad
tale
said
the
Mouse
turning
to
Alice
and
sighing
It
is
a
long
tail
certainly
said
Alice
looking
down
with
wonder
at
the
Mouse's
tail
but
why
do
you
call
it
sad
And
she
kept
on
puzzling
about
it
while
the
Mouse
was
speaking
so
that
her
idea
of
the
tale
was
something
like
this
Fury
said
to
a
mouse
That
he
met
in
the
house
Let
us
both
go
to
law
I
will
prosecute
you
Come
I'll
take
no
denial
We
must
have
the
trial
For
really
this
morning
I've
nothing
to
do
Said
the
mouse
to
the
cur
Such
a
trial
dear
sir
With
no
jury
or
judge
would
be
wasting
our
breath
I'll
be
judge
I'll
be
jury
said
cunning
old
Fury
I'll
try
the
whole
cause
and
condemn
you
to
death
You
are
not
attending
said
the
Mouse
to
Alice
severely
What
are
you
thinking
of
I
beg
your
pardon
said
Alice
very
humbly
you
had
got
to
the
fifth
bend
I
think
You
insult
me
by
talking
such
nonsense
said
the
Mouse
getting
up
and
walking
away
Please
come
back
and
finish
your
story
Alice
called
after
it
And
the
others
all
joined
in
chorus
Yes
please
do
But
the
Mouse
only
shook
its
head
impatiently
and
walked
a
little
quicker
I
wish
I
had
Dinah
our
cat
here
said
Alice
This
caused
a
remarkable
sensation
among
the
party
Some
of
the
birds
hurried
off
at
once
and
a
Canary
called
out
in
a
trembling
voice
to
its
children
Come
away
my
dears
It's
high
time
you
were
all
in
bed
On
various
pretexts
they
all
moved
off
and
Alice
was
soon
left
alone
I
wish
I
hadn't
mentioned
Dinah
Nobody
seems
to
like
her
down
here
and
I'm
sure
she's
the
best
cat
in
the
world
Poor
Alice
began
to
cry
again
for
she
felt
very
lonely
and
low
spirited
In
a
little
while
however
she
again
heard
a
little
pattering
of
footsteps
in
the
distance
and
she
looked
up
eagerly

IV
THE
RABBIT
SENDS
IN
A
LITTLE
BILL
It
was
the
White
Rabbit
trotting
slowly
back
again
and
looking
anxiously
about
as
it
went
as
if
it
had
lost
something
Alice
heard
it
muttering
to
itself
The
Duchess
The
Duchess
Oh
my
dear
paws
Oh
my
fur
and
whiskers
She'll
get
me
executed
as
sure
as
ferrets
are
ferrets
Where
can
I
have
dropped
them
I
wonder
Alice
guessed
in
a
moment
that
it
was
looking
for
the
fan
and
the
pair
of
white
kid
gloves
and
she
very
good
naturedly
began
hunting
about
for
them
but
they
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
everything
seemed
to
have
changed
since
her
swim
in
the
pool
and
the
great
hall
with
the
glass
table
and
the
little
door
had
vanished
completely
Very
soon
the
Rabbit
noticed
Alice
and
called
to
her
in
an
angry
tone
Why
Mary
Ann
what
are
you
doing
out
here
Run
home
this
moment
and
fetch
me
a
pair
of
gloves
and
a
fan
Quick
now
He
took
me
for
his
housemaid
said
Alice
as
she
ran
off
How
surprised
he'll
be
when
he
finds
out
who
I
am
As
she
said
this
she
came
upon
a
neat
little
house
on
the
door
of
which
was
a
bright
brass
plate
with
the
name
W
RABBIT
engraved
upon
it
She
went
in
without
knocking
and
hurried
upstairs
in
great
fear
lest
she
should
meet
the
real
Mary
Ann
and
be
turned
out
of
the
house
before
she
had
found
the
fan
and
gloves
By
this
time
Alice
had
found
her
way
into
a
tidy
little
room
with
a
table
in
the
window
and
on
it
a
fan
and
two
or
three
pairs
of
tiny
white
kid
gloves
she
took
up
the
fan
and
a
pair
of
the
gloves
and
was
just
going
to
leave
the
room
when
her
eyes
fell
upon
a
little
bottle
that
stood
near
the
looking
glass
She
uncorked
it
and
put
it
to
her
lips
saying
to
herself
I
do
hope
it'll
make
me
grow
large
again
for
really
I'm
quite
tired
of
being
such
a
tiny
little
thing
Before
she
had
drunk
half
the
bottle
she
found
her
head
pressing
against
the
ceiling
and
had
to
stoop
to
save
her
neck
from
being
broken
She
hastily
put
down
the
bottle
remarking
That's
quite
enough
I
hope
I
sha'n't
grow
any
more
Alas
It
was
too
late
to
wish
that
She
went
on
growing
and
growing
and
very
soon
she
had
to
kneel
down
on
the
floor
Still
she
went
on
growing
and
as
a
last
resource
she
put
one
arm
out
of
the
window
and
one
foot
up
the
chimney
and
said
to
herself
Now
I
can
do
no
more
whatever
happens
What
will
become
of
me
Illustration
Luckily
for
Alice
the
little
magic
bottle
had
now
had
its
full
effect
and
she
grew
no
larger
After
a
few
minutes
she
heard
a
voice
outside
and
stopped
to
listen
Mary
Ann
Mary
Ann
said
the
voice
Fetch
me
my
gloves
this
moment
Then
came
a
little
pattering
of
feet
on
the
stairs
Alice
knew
it
was
the
Rabbit
coming
to
look
for
her
and
she
trembled
till
she
shook
the
house
quite
forgetting
that
she
was
now
about
a
thousand
times
as
large
as
the
Rabbit
and
had
no
reason
to
be
afraid
of
it
Presently
the
Rabbit
came
up
to
the
door
and
tried
to
open
it
but
as
the
door
opened
inwards
and
Alice's
elbow
was
pressed
hard
against
it
that
attempt
proved
a
failure
Alice
heard
it
say
to
itself
Then
I'll
go
round
and
get
in
at
the
window
That
you
won't
thought
Alice
and
after
waiting
till
she
fancied
she
heard
the
Rabbit
just
under
the
window
she
suddenly
spread
out
her
hand
and
made
a
snatch
in
the
air
She
did
not
get
hold
of
anything
but
she
heard
a
little
shriek
and
a
fall
and
a
crash
of
broken
glass
from
which
she
concluded
that
it
was
just
possible
it
had
fallen
into
a
cucumber
frame
or
something
of
that
sort
Next
came
an
angry
voice
the
Rabbit's
Pat
Pat
Where
are
you
And
then
a
voice
she
had
never
heard
before
Sure
then
I'm
here
Digging
for
apples
yer
honor
Here
Come
and
help
me
out
of
this
Now
tell
me
Pat
what's
that
in
the
window
Sure
it's
an
arm
yer
honor
Well
it's
got
no
business
there
at
any
rate
go
and
take
it
away
There
was
a
long
silence
after
this
and
Alice
could
only
hear
whispers
now
and
then
and
at
last
she
spread
out
her
hand
again
and
made
another
snatch
in
the
air
This
time
there
were
two
little
shrieks
and
more
sounds
of
broken
glass
I
wonder
what
they'll
do
next
thought
Alice
As
for
pulling
me
out
of
the
window
I
only
wish
they
could
She
waited
for
some
time
without
hearing
anything
more
At
last
came
a
rumbling
of
little
cart
wheels
and
the
sound
of
a
good
many
voices
all
talking
together
She
made
out
the
words
Where's
the
other
ladder
Bill's
got
the
other
Bill
Here
Bill
Will
the
roof
bear
Who's
to
go
down
the
chimney
Nay
I
sha'n't
You
do
it
Here
Bill
The
master
says
you've
got
to
go
down
the
chimney
Alice
drew
her
foot
as
far
down
the
chimney
as
she
could
and
waited
till
she
heard
a
little
animal
scratching
and
scrambling
about
in
the
chimney
close
above
her
then
she
gave
one
sharp
kick
and
waited
to
see
what
would
happen
next
The
first
thing
she
heard
was
a
general
chorus
of
There
goes
Bill
then
the
Rabbit's
voice
alone
Catch
him
you
by
the
hedge
Then
silence
and
then
another
confusion
of
voices
Hold
up
his
head
Brandy
now
Don't
choke
him
What
happened
to
you
Last
came
a
little
feeble
squeaking
voice
Well
I
hardly
know
No
more
thank
ye
I'm
better
now
all
I
know
is
something
comes
at
me
like
a
Jack
in
the
box
and
up
I
goes
like
a
sky
rocket
After
a
minute
or
two
of
silence
they
began
moving
about
again
and
Alice
heard
the
Rabbit
say
A
barrowful
will
do
to
begin
with
A
barrowful
of
what
thought
Alice
But
she
had
not
long
to
doubt
for
the
next
moment
a
shower
of
little
pebbles
came
rattling
in
at
the
window
and
some
of
them
hit
her
in
the
face
Alice
noticed
with
some
surprise
that
the
pebbles
were
all
turning
into
little
cakes
as
they
lay
on
the
floor
and
a
bright
idea
came
into
her
head
If
I
eat
one
of
these
cakes
she
thought
it's
sure
to
make
some
change
in
my
size
So
she
swallowed
one
of
the
cakes
and
was
delighted
to
find
that
she
began
shrinking
directly
As
soon
as
she
was
small
enough
to
get
through
the
door
she
ran
out
of
the
house
and
found
quite
a
crowd
of
little
animals
and
birds
waiting
outside
They
all
made
a
rush
at
Alice
the
moment
she
appeared
but
she
ran
off
as
hard
as
she
could
and
soon
found
herself
safe
in
a
thick
wood
Illustration
The
Duchess
tucked
her
arm
affectionately
into
Alice's
The
first
thing
I've
got
to
do
said
Alice
to
herself
as
she
wandered
about
in
the
wood
is
to
grow
to
my
right
size
again
and
the
second
thing
is
to
find
my
way
into
that
lovely
garden
I
suppose
I
ought
to
eat
or
drink
something
or
other
but
the
great
question
is
What
Alice
looked
all
around
her
at
the
flowers
and
the
blades
of
grass
but
she
could
not
see
anything
that
looked
like
the
right
thing
to
eat
or
drink
under
the
circumstances
There
was
a
large
mushroom
growing
near
her
about
the
same
height
as
herself
She
stretched
herself
up
on
tiptoe
and
peeped
over
the
edge
and
her
eyes
immediately
met
those
of
a
large
blue
caterpillar
that
was
sitting
on
the
top
with
its
arms
folded
quietly
smoking
a
long
hookah
and
taking
not
the
smallest
notice
of
her
or
of
anything
else

V
ADVICE
FROM
A
CATERPILLAR
At
last
the
Caterpillar
took
the
hookah
out
of
its
mouth
and
addressed
Alice
in
a
languid
sleepy
voice
Who
are
you
said
the
Caterpillar
Illustration
Alice
replied
rather
shyly
I
I
hardly
know
sir
just
at
present
at
least
I
know
who
I
was
when
I
got
up
this
morning
but
I
think
I
must
have
changed
several
times
since
then
What
do
you
mean
by
that
said
the
Caterpillar
sternly
Explain
yourself
I
can't
explain
myself
I'm
afraid
sir
said
Alice
because
I'm
not
myself
you
see
being
so
many
different
sizes
in
a
day
is
very
confusing
She
drew
herself
up
and
said
very
gravely
I
think
you
ought
to
tell
me
who
you
are
first
Why
said
the
Caterpillar
As
Alice
could
not
think
of
any
good
reason
and
the
Caterpillar
seemed
to
be
in
a
very
unpleasant
state
of
mind
she
turned
away
Come
back
the
Caterpillar
called
after
her
I've
something
important
to
say
Alice
turned
and
came
back
again
Keep
your
temper
said
the
Caterpillar
Is
that
all
said
Alice
swallowing
down
her
anger
as
well
as
she
could
No
said
the
Caterpillar
It
unfolded
its
arms
took
the
hookah
out
of
its
mouth
again
and
said
So
you
think
you're
changed
do
you
I'm
afraid
I
am
sir
said
Alice
I
can't
remember
things
as
I
used
and
I
don't
keep
the
same
size
for
ten
minutes
together
What
size
do
you
want
to
be
asked
the
Caterpillar
Oh
I'm
not
particular
as
to
size
Alice
hastily
replied
only
one
doesn't
like
changing
so
often
you
know
I
should
like
to
be
a
little
larger
sir
if
you
wouldn't
mind
said
Alice
Three
inches
is
such
a
wretched
height
to
be
It
is
a
very
good
height
indeed
said
the
Caterpillar
angrily
rearing
itself
upright
as
it
spoke
it
was
exactly
three
inches
high
In
a
minute
or
two
the
Caterpillar
got
down
off
the
mushroom
and
crawled
away
into
the
grass
